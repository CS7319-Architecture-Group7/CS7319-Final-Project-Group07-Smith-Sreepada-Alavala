#### Install MySQL

If MySQL is already installed ignore below steps

- Downlod the installation package from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

- Recommended version: MySQL Community Server 8.4.3 LTS
- Note: you do not need t login to download the installation package. Looks for the option to download without login.

- During installation, when prompted for root user password use "mysmu@123" or based on your preference.
- Downalod MySQL Workbench installation package from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/
- Connect to the local MySQL instance from MySQL Workbench and run the sql script from DB folder

#### Install RabbitMQ

If RabbitMQ is already installed, please ignore these steps.

Based on the operating system, download and install RabbitMQ 
https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/platforms

#### For macOS, the recommended option is to use <b>Homebrew</b>
```bash
brew update
```
```bash
brew install rabbitmq
```
To find out locations for your installation, use:
```bash
brew info rabbitmq
```
Run the RabbitMQ Server Node as a background service

```bash
brew services start rabbitmq
```

Highly recommended: enable all feature flags on the running node

For Apple Silicon Macs
```bash
/opt/homebrew/sbin/rabbitmqctl enable_feature_flag all
```
For Intel Macs
```bash
/usr/local/opt/rabbitmq/sbin/rabbitmqctl enable_feature_flag all
```

For Stopping the service
```bash
brew services stop rabbitmq
```

#### For Windows, the recommended option is to use <b>Chocolatey</b>

To install RabbitMQ using Chocolatey, run the following command from the command line or from PowerShell:

```ps
choco install rabbitmq
```

More information can be foound here.
https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/install-windows#chocolatey


#### Install Git Tools

Install Git Tools from below URL.
https://git-scm.com/downloads


#### Install Visual Studio Code

Install latest version of Visual Studio Code from below URL
https://code.visualstudio.com/download


#### Clone the Git Repository

Create new folder
```bash
md CS7319-Final-Project-Group07-Smith-Sreepada-Alavala
```
Change to new folder
```bash
cd CS7319-Final-Project-Group07-Smith-Sreepada-Alavala
```

Clone Git Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CS7319-Architecture-Group7/CS7319-Final-Project-Group07-Smith-Sreepada-Alavala.git
```


### Before running the application

#### Set up the Local Environment:
- Run the DB Scripts from ./DB/PollManagement_SQL_Script_DDL.sql in MySQL Workbench to create PollManagement database schema with all necessary SQL Objects.
- You should have received the .env files for frontend and backend applications through email. If not, please send us an email.
- Copy the FrontEnd ".env" file for frontend application in "./selected/frontend" and "./unselected/frontend/" folders
- Copy the BackEnd ".env" file for backend application in "./selected/backend" and "./unselected/backend/" folders

#### Running the "selected" application.

- Open two terminals in MacOS or two Command Prompts in Windows OS.
- Navigate to "./selected/backend/" folder in frist terminal or command prompt and run below commands
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
If there are no errors, backend application must start and listen to port 5001 on localhost

- Navigate to "./selected/frontend/" folder in second terminal or command prompt and run below commands
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
If there are no errors, frontend application must start and listen to port 3000 on localhost as well as open the default browser

Open additional browsers for testing the poll updates.
We recommend having 2 browsers in below layout to observe the Poll Result updates in a better way.

<table border=2 width="100%" height="100px">
    <tr>
        <td align=center>Browser 1</td>
        <td align=center>Browser 2</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Use Browser 1 for all the changes like, creating, updating, and delting polls. Once enough polls are created, use Browser 2 to observe the Poll results when polls are voted from Browser 1.

#### Running the "unselected" application

Repeat the same steps above in "./unselected/" folder.

The backend application will start on port 5002 and frontend application will start on port 3001

### Difference between the architecture designs for both candidate architecture styles

The <b>Client-Server Architecture</b> is characterized by a centralized server that handles requests from multiple clients. This architecture is straightforward to implement and manage, making it ideal for applications with simple, predictable interactions. It allows for centralized control over data and security, ensuring that all clients interact with a single source of truth. However, it can become a bottleneck as the number of clients increases, leading to potential performance issues and scalability challenges. Additionally, real-time updates are harder to implement efficiently, often requiring clients to poll the server frequently.

The <b>Publisher-Subscriber (Pub-Sub) Architecture</b> is designed to handle real-time updates and scalability more effectively. In this model, publishers send messages to a message broker, which then distributes these messages to all subscribed clients. This decouples the producers and consumers of data, allowing for more flexible and scalable systems. The Pub-Sub architecture excels in scenarios where real-time data dissemination is crucial, as it enables instant updates to all subscribers without the need for constant polling. However, it introduces additional complexity in managing the message broker and ensuring message delivery, which can require more sophisticated infrastructure and monitoring.

### The rationale for final selection

Proposed Selection: <b>Client-Server Architecture</b>

We initially chose the Client-Server architecture for its simplicity and centralized control, which made it easier to implement, maintain, and manage security in the application. Additionally, the centralized nature of this architecture aligned well with the initial requirements for a straightforward, small-scale system with no need for real-time updates

Final Selection: <b>Publisher-Subscriber Architecture</b>

As the project evolved, the need for real-time updates in displaying poll results became critical, which the Client-Server architecture struggled to handle efficiently. The Pub-Sub architectureâ€™s event-driven model provided instant updates to subscribers without the need for constant polling, reducing unnecessary traffic. Additionally, the scalability offered by Pub-Sub, with its ability to handle large numbers of users and events through a message broker, proved more suitable for the growing user base. The loosely coupled nature of Pub-Sub allowed for more flexibility and easier management of components as the system complexity increased. Finally, the improved user experience from real-time interaction made Pub-Sub the optimal choice for this application.
