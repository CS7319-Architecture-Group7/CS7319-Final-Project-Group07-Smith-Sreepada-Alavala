Create (CREATE) 3 different users (User1, User2, User3).

Clear all data from database (except users).

Run both apps simultaneously on different ports.

Login with user 1 via Chrome browser on the client server model.
Open the page to "Top Polls".

Login with user 2 via Safari browser on the client server model.
Login with user 3 via Safari browser on the pub sub model.

Alternating between models, after each poll, create (CREATE) 10 new polls using Q1 - Q10 from the data set below.  Odd polls on client server, even numbered on pub sub.  This ensures even each architecture is working with a fairly even data load in database as we progress.  

Next, again continuing with the alternating between models, respond to each poll using the links from the "Top Polls" page.  Respond to the even polls from client server architecture and respond to the odd numbered polls from pub sub model.  This way users are not answering their own polls.  Follow the same procedure for adding a comment to each poll.

Now, in each window, navigate to the "My Polls" page.  Alternating between models, view the results for each poll in the list (5 for each user). Delete the first poll from each list.  Delete the last poll from each list.  Update the date for the first item from the remaining list on each model.  Update the date for the last poll from the remaining list on each model.

Logout and close the Safari windows for user 2 and user 3.  

Go back to the Chrome window for user 1.  Logout and Log back in as user 1 to be sure your token is fresh.  View the performance comparison by clcking on the link in the footer.
